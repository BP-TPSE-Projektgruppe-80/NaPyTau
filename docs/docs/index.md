# Welcome to NapyTau

## About

NapyTau is a Python project, made as a successor to the Napatau tool. It's primary purpose is to calculate `Tau`, also
known as the lifetime. NapyTau primarily aims at modernizing the user experience of the original Napatau tool, by providing
a more user-friendly interface and a more modern look. Furthermore, NapyTau provides a command line interface, allowing its usage in automated scripts.

## Tech Stack

The NapyTau source is written entirely in Python, with the GUI being built using the `tkinter` library. Specifically, the `customtk` component library is used to provide a more modern look to the GUI. To facilitate efficient calculations, the ubiquitous `numpy` and `scipy` libraries are used.

The project also provides pre-built binaries for Windows and Linux, which are built using `Nuitka`.

Finally, this documentation is built using `mkdocs` and `mkdocs-material`.
