# Reader

The Reader component serves as an abstraction layer for accessing data from various sources. Each specific type of reader is implemented as a subclass, tailored to handle a particular data source type. These subclasses encapsulate the logic required to retrieve and process data, ensuring a structured and uniform approach to data acquisition.

A reader's primary responsibility is to define how a given data source is identified and to provide a facade over the underlying data-fetching implementation. This abstraction simplifies data access for other modules, shielding them from the complexities of direct interaction with different storage formats or retrieval mechanisms.

It is important to note that the reader itself is not responsible for locating the data source. The system must supply the necessary reference or connection details, allowing the reader to focus solely on extracting and transforming the data as needed.
