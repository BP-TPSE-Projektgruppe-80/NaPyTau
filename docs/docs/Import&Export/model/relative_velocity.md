# Relative Velocity

The `Relative Velocity` class is a wrapper around a floating point value. It restricts the value to be in the range of 0 to 1. It is used to represent the velocity of particles measured in the experiment relative to lightspeed. The class also provides the functionality to be compared to another relative velocity using the `=` operator.
